We could all use some practice. Why not take some time to build a Slack clone in the oddest way possible? That's what this repository is. I'll be streaming development on this application to https://twitch.tv/mdwheele nightly and you can follow along if you want to.

Together, we'll be reviewing tools like Vue, Express, Node, JavaScript, Websockets, Tailwind CSS and whatever else we want to because it's our Slack clone and we'll do what we want to.

**Structure**

Nightly streams will be structured around a project backlog organized at https://github.com/mdwheele/whack/projects/1. We'll use the end of every stream to figure out what is most interesting to work on next. I've already placed some ideas there to start things off. 

Every story we implement will be wrapped in a separate [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) that will contain a lot of background information, relevant links, thought process and more. I'll be labeling our Pull Requests so that it is easy to go back and find all the "Vue" PRs (Pull Requests).

**Goals**

1. First and foremost, I would love for this to serve as an example to folks that are trying to break into software development. We're going to have a LOT of our thought process "baked" into each and every pull request and [Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) so feel free to open up a discussion on any of the work we do and we can have a conversation. I'm even down to do online pairing / mentoring during streams if folks are interested.
2. Web development is hard! And it's very easy to get comfortable with the daily grind and the tools you use. I want to branch out and try different ways of doing things, different technologies, etc. So, I want this Slack clone to be "weird" in a lot of ways. So we're going to get weird with it.
3. ???
4. I don't know, we'll come back to this.
